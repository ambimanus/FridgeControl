# FridgeControl
A fridge controller software for the Atmel AVR platform, written in uC. This is a follow-up work from my masters thesis project, the topic was "modelling and evaluation of desynchronization strategies for controllable cooling devices".

This code was used to implement a hardware controller for fridge devices. I used an Atmel AVR for this; in particular, a beginner's development-board from roboternetz.de was used as platform. The goal was to transfer the desynchronization strategies from the masters thesis to real devices by equipping standard fridges with a smart controller.

Beware, this is from 2009 :)
